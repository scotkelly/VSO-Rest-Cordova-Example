# VSO REST Cordova Example 
This project is a simple example of how to load a list of projects on a Visual Studio Online (VSO) account, using the [VSO REST API](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/api/overview). 

The most interesting code is in the scripts/vsoloader.js file.

The project was built using the default Blank Cordova app template in Visual Studio 2015, and tested as an Android application. You should be able to build this with any flavor of Visual Studio 2015, including the free [Community edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx).
